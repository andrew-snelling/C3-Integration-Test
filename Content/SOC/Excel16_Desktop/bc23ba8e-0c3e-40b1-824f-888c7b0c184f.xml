    <para>
      <legacyBold>Issues that cause a minor loss of fidelity</legacyBold> might or might not have to be resolved before you continue saving the workbook—data or functionality is not lost, but the workbook might not look or work exactly the same way when you open it in an earlier version of Microsoft Excel.</para>
