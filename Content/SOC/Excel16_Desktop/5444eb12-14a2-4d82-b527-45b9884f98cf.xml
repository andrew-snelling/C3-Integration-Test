If Office Professional Plus 2013 or later is installed on your computer, the Spreadsheet Inquire add-in is available in Excel.</para> <para>You can use the commands on the <ui>Inquire</ui> tab to do all these tasks and more. The <ui>Inquire</ui> tab on the Excel ribbon has buttons for the commands described below.</para> <para> <mediaLinkInline> <image xlink:href="73e4f55b-9d0b-428c-a4a1-8b47649f04fd" /> </mediaLinkInline></para> <para>If you don't see the <ui>Inquire</ui> tab in the Excel ribbon, see <link xlink:href="6bc668e2-f3c6-4729-8ce1-75ea20aa9d90">Turn on the Spreadsheet Inquire add-in</link>. </para> </introduction> <section address="__toc320796980"> <title>Compare two workbooks</title> <content> <para>The <ui>Compare Files</ui> command lets you see the differences, cell by cell, between two workbooks.

In the relationship diagram, you can select elements and find more information about them, and drag connection lines to change the shape of the diagram.</para> <para>This diagram shows the current workbook on the left and the connections between it and other workbooks and data sources.

Use the <ui>Worksheet Relationship Diagram</ui> to create an interactive, graphical map of connections (links) between worksheets both in the same workbook and in other workbooks. This helps give you a clearer picture of how your data might depend on cells in other places.<br /><br />This diagram shows the relationships between worksheets in four different workbooks, with dependencies between worksheets in the same workbook as well as links between worksheets in different workbooks. When you position your pointer over a node in the diagram, such as the worksheet named "West" in the diagram, a balloon containing information appears.</para> <para> <mediaLinkInline> <image xlink:href="55d7876e-1ee8-46c1-93f8-30a55d6bf0a2"> </image> </mediaLinkInline> </para> <para>To learn more, read <link xlink:href="e7d7a6b8-6329-4867-ab8c-0262405dbd48">See links between worksheets</link>.</para> </content> <sections /> </section> <section address="__toc320796985"> <title>Show cell relationships</title> <content> <para>To get a detailed, interactive diagram of all links from a selected cell to cells in other worksheets or even other workbooks, use the <ui>Cell Relationship</ui> tool.

The diagram can cross worksheets and workbooks.</para> <para>This diagram shows two levels of cell relationships for cell A10 on Sheet5 in Book1.xlsx. This cell is dependent on cell C6 on Sheet 1 in another workbook, Book2.xlsx.
