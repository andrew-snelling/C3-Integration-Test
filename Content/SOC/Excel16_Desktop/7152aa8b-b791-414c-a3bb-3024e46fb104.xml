		<para>You and your colleagues can open and work on the same Excel workbook. This is called co-authoring. When you co-author, you can see each other's changes quickly — in a matter of seconds. And with certain versions of Excel, you'll see other people's selections in different colors. If you're using a version of Excel that supports co-authoring, you select <ui>Share</ui> in the upper-right corner, type email addresses, and then choose a cloud location. But if you need more details, like which versions are supported and where the file can be stored, this article will walk you through the process.</para>

											<para>In general, the last change that is saved, either with the <ui>Save</ui> button or automatically with <ui>AutoSave</ui>, is the one that “wins.” There are some exceptions to this, but that’s generally how it works. If you don’t want to have conflicts with other people, assign areas or sheets to each person.

										<title>What happens when two people make a change to the same thing?</title>
										<content>
											<para>In general, the last change that is saved, either with the <ui>Save</ui> button or automatically with <ui>AutoSave</ui>, is the one that “wins.” There are some exceptions to this, but that’s generally how it works. If you don’t want to have conflicts with other people, assign areas or sheets to each person. You can explain these assignments when you send the link out, or you can make the assignments obvious in the workbook itself by putting people’s names in heading cells, or naming sheets with people’s names.</para>
											<para>Keep in mind that if someone is using OneDrive to sync files, changes they make while their computer is offline won't get merged until their computer is online again. And once online, all their changes get merged at once.</para>

											<para>In Excel Mobile, tap <ui>File</ui> &gt; <ui>History</ui>. Then tap a past version, and it will open. If you want to restore it to the current version, wait until everyone is no longer co-authoring, and then tap <ui>Restore this version</ui>.</para>
