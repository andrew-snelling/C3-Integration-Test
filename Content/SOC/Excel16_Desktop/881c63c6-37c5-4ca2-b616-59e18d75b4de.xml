				<title>How do I use Get &amp; Transform?</title>
				<content>
					<para>To use <legacyBold>Get &amp; Transform</legacyBold> in Excel, you create a <legacyItalic>query</legacyItalic> in your workbook. A <legacyItalic>query</legacyItalic> enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources. You can then load that transformed data into a table, or into the built-in Data Model in Excel, and even refresh that data later on. You can also edit the query whenever you need to, and share your query, too.</para>
					<para>To create a query in Excel, use the <legacyBold>Data</legacyBold> tab in the ribbon, then select the <legacyBold>Get Data</legacyBold> button from the <legacyBold>Get &amp; Transform Data</legacyBold> ribbon group. From there, choose your data source. </para>
