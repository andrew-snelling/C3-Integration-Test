  <introduction>
    <para>When you work on a file that's stored in a SharePoint library, your administrator may have configured it to create <link xlink:href="0f6cd105-974f-44a4-aadb-43ac5bdfd247">versions</link> as you work. This lets you refer to an older version of the file if you want to see your past work. There are two types of versions that can be tracked for a file: major and minor. However, there is a limit to the number of minor versions that can be created.</para>

But the second copy will be brand new and not have any versions created yet, until you work on it.</para></content>
